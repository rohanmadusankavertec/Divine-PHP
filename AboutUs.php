                            <h3>History</h3><br />
                            <p>
                                Mrs Manel Fernando was the family cake baker for family and friends. Her tasteful and fluffy sponged cakes with butter icing were a huge hit. 
                                Hence in 1989 she started to bake and sell cakes from home on orders. Within months she hired an employee as the orders were flowing through and came up with a name for her cakes; “Divine”. 
                                The word was spreading around Colombo of this lady and her wonderful cakes. Soon she took on more staff and then started her first outlet in 1992. Over the years, the name “Divine” grew synonymous with cakes and the popularity of the cakes soared. 
                                All this came to be without any form of advertising, except that of the word of mouth of our customers, which spread like wild fire around Colombo and it’s suburbs. </p>
                        
                            <br/>
                            Then in 2006 with the help and encouragement of her family, a company was registered under the name of “Divine Foods (Pvt) Ltd” with the intention of catering and expanding to the growing demand for quality cakes. 
                            By now the name “Divine” was a recognised household name in Colombo.
                            <br/>
                            Currently the company’s headquarters and main outlet is located at Queens Rd and has branches in Colpetty, Borella and Pelawatte. The company has now ventured into other areas such as pastry and bakery, local and Chinese cuisine and also offers catering services. The company as we consider is still in it’s infancy with around 70 employees. The very first employee that was hired in 1989 is still with the “Divine family”.

                            <h3>Company</h3><br />
                            <p>
                                Divine Foods (PVT) LTD was incorporated as a company in April 2006. 
                                The business has been trading for the last 20 years. The core business is in manufacturing high quality cakes for the local market. Sales have been increasing year after  year. The “Divine” brand name is a very well known among the community in Colombo and it’s suburbs.  
                                Divine Foods (PVT) LTD is one of the market leaders in supplying quality cakes in Colombo. The business has been purely built up through word of mouth, not having done much advertising at all. The company is renowned for it’s quality and taste in it’s products. We have built up a regular base of clientele, that keeps on growing.

                             <h3>Why so popular ?</h3><br />
                            <p>
                               Simply ask any of customers.
                               <br>
                               <br>
Our policy has always been to manufacture high quality cakes, using the best ingredients available. The cakes are baked at the correct temperature to perfection, resulting in the baked dough becoming fluffy. 
Hence our cakes are very palatable. Our basic cakes such as the ribbon, chocolate, butter and coffee are best sellers in the local market arising from their sheer simple taste. Our uncompromising approach on quality has made us one of the leading brand names in cakes in Colombo. 
Hence we only sell our cakes through our own outlets, so that the same quality product can be guaranteed to our customers, time and again. <br />
                            
                            
                            
                            <h3>The cake renowned around the globe – love cake.</h3><br />
                            <p>
                                The product branded as “love cake” is one of our best sellers. Around 80 % of our production in this product is bought and taken overseas by our existing clientele and Sri Lankan expatriates. This is because the cake is very unique in taste and unmatched.
                                This cake is mostly taken to the UK, Australia, Canada, US and Singapore. Hence our brand name is known to a good proportion of the Sri Lankan expatriate community living in these countries. Our Divine brand and packaging for the love cake is usually reconigned by customs officials in the airports of these countries, giving proof to our testimony.
